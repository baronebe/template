		<h1>Blog Entry 1</h1>
		<p> The purpose of this video is to get a message across that it doesnt't
		hurt to be gay or a lesbian. Its your life and you should live it exactly 
		how you want, you should be with whoever you want, whoever makes you happy.
		Don't let others get in the way of your life, live it how you want. This video
		is very inspirational to me and should inspire many people who may be scared to
		"come out of the closet" to not be. If you truly are happy and want to be with someone
		no other person should stop you. In the video, he writes to his uncle who passed away
		due to suicide because he was gay and always got criticized for it. This is unaccecptable
		and no on should ever be criticized for something they cant control. Love is a beautiful
		thing and everyone should be entitled to love whoever they want, no matter the gender.</p>
		<p>The structure of the message he is sending is in four parts. The first part is a silent 
		slide show, it really grabs your attention and made me interested in what was going on.
		The second part is the poem where it leads up the the third part which is the story about
		his uncle. The final part is him saying a few last things to his uncle, the structure
		of this video is very good.</p>

		<p>The people targeted in this are computer gamers, people that have any experience with WoW will get a kick out of this. Anyone that knows anything about gaming knows about WoW, and can understand most of the refrences. The issues are that people will just go online to communicate with people, and not go out. This is an inherent problem with our generation, and is making a lot of us socially innept.

The creators are making fun of a very large issue in society, and they aren't approaching it very seriously. The point of south park is to do that, so I can't really blame them. The should have taken a more mild approach, and talked about how this issue is widespread, and needs to be fixed.</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 3</h1>
		<p>The Chrysler commercial for the Chrysler 200 portrays Detroit in a different way than most think of the city as. Detroit has been to hell and back and has had some very big down falls. The commercial doesn’t try to sugar coat what Detroit has been through, instead the creators chose to think of Detroit’s past as a building block that has made it a much stronger city. Because of this, the Chrysler 200 is seen to be a strong car. The song lose yourself by Eminem is included in this video due to the fact that he was born and raised in Detroit. Eminem is included to show that even though Detroit may be a not so great city currently, and even though it has had some hard falls, good can still come out of the city. Eminem is a very successful rap artist that is from Detroit. He has shown that Detroit is not a city full of failure. This commercial gives viewers a different perspective of Detroit that it is a very strong and unique city, just like the Chrysler 200. The tag line “Imported from Detroit” sends a very strong message to viewers. The definition of the word import from Merriam-Webster is to bring a product into a country to be sold. The main word that sticks out of that definition is country. Obviously, Detroit is in the United States, not in a different country, so why include the word imported? This is done to show how unique Detroit is. The US does not have any other city like Detroit. Detroit stands out, it is anything but ordinary. Detroit is like another country compared to the rest of the US. The creators included this to show how extraordinary Detroit is, along with the Chrysler 200. The main purpose of this ad is to show viewers how great of a car the Chrysler 200 is. By doing this, they compare it to Detroit, where the car is from, showing how strong and unique the car is, just like Detroit.</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 4</h1>
		<p>We were introduced to the website today, as well as our first project: Lived Experiences. My overall impression of the website is that it will make the class much easier to keep track. I wont ever be confused of anything going on in class and I should always be prepared. The Lived Experiences sounds interesting, and I am ready to start working on my paper. GitHub is also very confusing to me. I dont understand how to use it and was so confused in class. Hopefully I can learn it!

		<h1>Blog Entry 5</h1>
		<p>Still working on Lived Experiences project, so far so good with the whole thing. Im pretty much right on track to have it finished well before Wednesday. Im still having some troubles with GitHub but it is sort of coming to me now. The peer review helped me out a lot and I got a good amount of feed back about my paper. We started CodeAcadamy and its pretty easy, I just find it meaningless because they give us the answers and Ill never use this in life.</p>
