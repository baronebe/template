		<h1>Blog Entry 1</h1>
		<p> The purpose of this video is to get a message across that it doesnt't
		hurt to be gay or a lesbian. Its your life and you should live it exactly 
		how you want, you should be with whoever you want, whoever makes you happy.
		Don't let others get in the way of your life, live it how you want. This video
		is very inspirational to me and should inspire many people who may be scared to
		"come out of the closet" to not be. If you truly are happy and want to be with someone
		no other person should stop you. In the video, he writes to his uncle who passed away
		due to suicide because he was gay and always got criticized for it. This is unaccecptable
		and no on should ever be criticized for something they cant control. Love is a beautiful
		thing and everyone should be entitled to love whoever they want, no matter the gender.</p>
		<p>The structure of the message he is sending is in four parts. The first part is a silent 
		slide show, it really grabs your attention and made me interested in what was going on.
		The second part is the poem where it leads up the the third part which is the story about
		his uncle. The final part is him saying a few last things to his uncle, the structure
		of this video is very good.</p>

		<p>The people targeted in this are computer gamers, people that have any experience with WoW will get a kick out of this. Anyone that knows anything about gaming knows about WoW, and can understand most of the refrences. The issues are that people will just go online to communicate with people, and not go out. This is an inherent problem with our generation, and is making a lot of us socially innept.

The creators are making fun of a very large issue in society, and they aren't approaching it very seriously. The point of south park is to do that, so I can't really blame them. The should have taken a more mild approach, and talked about how this issue is widespread, and needs to be fixed.</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 3</h1>
		<p>The Chrysler commercial for the Chrysler 200 portrays Detroit in a different way than most think of the city as. Detroit has been to hell and back and has had some very big down falls. The commercial doesn’t try to sugar coat what Detroit has been through, instead the creators chose to think of Detroit’s past as a building block that has made it a much stronger city. Because of this, the Chrysler 200 is seen to be a strong car. The song lose yourself by Eminem is included in this video due to the fact that he was born and raised in Detroit. Eminem is included to show that even though Detroit may be a not so great city currently, and even though it has had some hard falls, good can still come out of the city. Eminem is a very successful rap artist that is from Detroit. He has shown that Detroit is not a city full of failure. This commercial gives viewers a different perspective of Detroit that it is a very strong and unique city, just like the Chrysler 200. The tag line “Imported from Detroit” sends a very strong message to viewers. The definition of the word import from Merriam-Webster is to bring a product into a country to be sold. The main word that sticks out of that definition is country. Obviously, Detroit is in the United States, not in a different country, so why include the word imported? This is done to show how unique Detroit is. The US does not have any other city like Detroit. Detroit stands out, it is anything but ordinary. Detroit is like another country compared to the rest of the US. The creators included this to show how extraordinary Detroit is, along with the Chrysler 200. The main purpose of this ad is to show viewers how great of a car the Chrysler 200 is. By doing this, they compare it to Detroit, where the car is from, showing how strong and unique the car is, just like Detroit.</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 4</h1>
		<p>We were introduced to the website today, as well as our first project: Lived Experiences. My overall impression of the website is that it will make the class much easier to keep track. I wont ever be confused of anything going on in class and I should always be prepared. The Lived Experiences sounds interesting, and I am ready to start working on my paper. GitHub is also very confusing to me. I dont understand how to use it and was so confused in class. Hopefully I can learn it!

</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 5</h1>
		<p>Still working on Lived Experiences project, so far so good with the whole thing. Im pretty much right on track to have it finished well before Wednesday. Im still having some troubles with GitHub but it is sort of coming to me now. The peer review helped me out a lot and I got a good amount of feed back about my paper. We started CodeAcadamy and its pretty easy, I just find it meaningless because they give us the answers and Ill never use this in life.</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 6</h1>
		<p>Finished Lived Experiences and starting up Cultural Analysis. I like this project a lot because it has a very diverse topic selection. I am going to write my paper on Grand Theft Auto and how it could influence a kid to commit the same crime as one in the game. CodeAcadamey is going good, I still think its pointless but its ok. I finally got GitHub down. </p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 7</h1>
		<p>This week we have to turn in an annotated bibliography for our formal research project. It's been really hard for me to find papers that I will be able to use in my essay, but overall I think that the ones I ended up chosing will be good ones, if I'll be able to explain and break them down clearly enough. Since one of the requirements for this project is for us to include the break down of at least one reasearch paper from a scientific journal and one from a trade publication, this activity I think will be very useful in achieving that. I'm also contuining the codecademy sections, and even though they are still sometimes confusing, they're starting to become a little bit clearer after every new section, and with some practice. I've also started to think about the person I am going to interview for the research paper</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 8</h1>
		<p>Formal research project drafting activity has been completed. The draft act required us to propose a draft and throw down what ideas we have in a guided format. These draft acts are nice for when it comes time to put together a final draft because the projects are formatted and some information has been put down. After writing the rest of your paper, whats left is just piecing together the pieces and making a final draft. I have been continuing to read articles on line and search for important information. I think that a lot of information will be provided by the interviews that I will conduct. I have also been searching for something that I can use as a source images in my project.</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 9</h1>
		<p>We had a power point in class about visuals of information in videos and power points. We also watched some commercials and saw different tactics that were used to show information. Watching the commercials was very beneficial because it made me realize how important visual is. There are many different aspects that go into making a video. For example, when telling the side effects of a medicine, producers tried to draw your attention away from all the bad side effects and tried to make viewers pay attention to the people that were smiling and moving around in the actual video. We also had an in class activity about the Chrysler commercial with Eminem. We were asked to explain what the imagery of Detroit is in the video, the inclusion of Eminem’s song “Lose Yourself”, the tag line of “imported from Detroit”, and the voiceover in the commercial. I liked this assignment because it made me realize that commercial producers put a lot of thought into their work and there are many different aspects to creating a commercial. We just began looking into the multimedia remix project for this class. This project give us the opportunity to revise and transmediate one of our earlier projects while turning it into a documentary. This is a group project that requires one of the members past project to expand on for this project. </p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 10</h1>
		<p>In class, we watched a documentary as an example of how to do our remix project. It was about aliens, and the research behind it, but more importantly it had the essential qualities that make up a good documentary. I thought that the video was pretty interesting, and I didn't really believe a word of it, despite the evidence, but I thought it was a great effort, and could have easily persuaded someone else watching. That's the kind of feedback my remix project should be aiming for. Something that has backed up evidence, is interesting, and is persausive enough to pass an idea or information to the audience.</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 11</h1>
		<p>During class, our group met up and we started thinking about what we should do our project on. No one really had any ideas until poverty came up and we decided we could make our documentary on poverty pretty easily. There is a lot of information out there on poverty and I think our documentary will be pretty good.</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 12</h1>
		<p>This week we didn't have anything new in class but instead we were given the time to work on our multimedia remix project. With the other members of my group we met outside of class and started looking for material that we would like to put in the video. We looked for a few fun and/or interesting facts, that might help us get the audience interested in our documentary. In addition we also did some research on what type of information we should include in our description of the major of advertising so that the viewers can get enough information to udnerstand what advertising is but at the same time not overwhelm them with too much information. We also tryed to figure out,with the help of the group member that is actually majoring in advertising, what advertising techniques we would want to incorporate in our short documentary.</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 13</h1>
		<p>This week our group met on Satuday night and we sat in the lib and got absolutlewy nothing done, none of us were very productive and we ended up just going home for the night and would eventually meet up to finish. We actually did get a couple things for the project though, we really were being sort of productive.</p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 14</h1>
		<p>We got together one last time as a group for our remix project to get it done. We had less than a minute of video, and not enough substance to fill the 6-8 minute requirement. I think, because of the tight time and procrastination, we were forced to work together as a group, and work very efficiently. After a few hours of braving work, we finnished our project, and it turned out much better than we initially thought it would. Everyone in the group was working efficiently, and if someone wasn't working, me or another member would find something for them to work on. As soon as we got the framework down, and we had the project organized, we printed out an outline of the project and split the different parts so everyone could work on a single task. </p>
		
		<h1>Blog Entry 15</h1>
		<p>Finally the last week of this course! The final retrospective project is still being worked on. I, and many others like me, am confused about how to go about the group aspect of this final project. It seems that one group assignment for a wra class is enough. I am in the formal research group and I hope we can organize enough to get some stuff done for the webmasters to put up on the website. The paper part is easy. I will describe all of the major assignments that we completed in the class. Through describing the assignments I will analyze their purpose and effectiveness to me as a student. I will use this information to review and edit my past assignments to improve them. Hopefully through this process I will have a great portfolio with a broad range of fine-tuned written projects. My last concern is for the groups that must work together to get the web up and running. Its hard to organize so many people with no class time.</p>
