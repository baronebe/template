		<h1>Blog Entry 1</h1>
		<p> The purpose of this video is to get a message across that it doesnt't
		hurt to be gay or a lesbian. Its your life and you should live it exactly 
		how you want, you should be with whoever you want, whoever makes you happy.
		Don't let others get in the way of your life, live it how you want. This video
		is very inspirational to me and should inspire many people who may be scared to
		"come out of the closet" to not be. If you truly are happy and want to be with someone
		no other person should stop you. In the video, he writes to his uncle who passed away
		due to suicide because he was gay and always got criticized for it. This is unaccecptable
		and no on should ever be criticized for something they cant control. Love is a beautiful
		thing and everyone should be entitled to love whoever they want, no matter the gender.</p>
		<p>The structure of the message he is sending is in four parts. The first part is a silent 
		slide show, it really grabs your attention and made me interested in what was going on.
		The second part is the poem where it leads up the the third part which is the story about
		his uncle. The final part is him saying a few last things to his uncle, the structure
		of this video is very good.</p>
	
		<h1>Blog Entry 2</h1>
		<p>The people targeted in this are computer gamers, people that have any experience with WoW will get a kick out of this. Anyone that knows anything about gaming knows about WoW, and can understand most of the refrences. The issues are that people will just go online to communicate with people, and not go out. This is an inherent problem with our generation, and is making a lot of us socially innept.

The creators are making fun of a very large issue in society, and they aren't approaching it very seriously. The point of south park is to do that, so I can't really blame them. The should have taken a more mild approach, and talked about how this issue is widespread, and needs to be fixed.</p>
