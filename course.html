		<p>WRA 110: Science and Technology has been a huge learning experience for me this semester. During the semester, we have done 4 major projects and this one will be the 5th. The five projects we have done are the Lived Experiences project, the cultural analysis project, the Formal Research project, the Multimedia Remix project, and finally this one, the Course Retrospective project. I am going to individually go through each project and break it down for students who may take this course in the future. The main goal of my paper is to make it as easy as I can for future students. 

The Lived Experiences project was writing about a piece of technology that has impacted your life, and impacted the major you selected. You had to include a personal story as to why it impacted your life. Personally, I really enjoyed writing this paper because I liked the topic and it was interesting seeing what piece of technology impacted others lives. Quickly I realized what I was going to write about. As a kid, I had very messed up teeth, and braces changed that for me, I declared my major as Pre-Dental because of braces and how much they meant to me.  The story I used was when I had very messed up teeth and kids would make fun of me for them, I always lacked self-confidence because I had messed up teeth, and braces changed my life.

	The second project we had was the Cultural Analysis project. This project was very interesting to me, I enjoyed researching and working on this project. The main goal of the project was to take a piece of media whether it be a TV show, movie, song, or video game and talk about how that piece of media can affect our society. I liked this project because there was such a big range of topics to choose from, and I definitely work better if its something I actually like researching.  The topic I chose was how Grand Theft Auto or any violent video game likewise can influence a child who doesn’t know any better to go out in the real world and repeat the crimes they saw in the game. A tip for this project is definitely to research something that you’re interested in, and have fun with it. For my project I literally played Grand Theft Auto for a couple hours seeing all the different crimes that are involved in the game and then got to research crazy statistics and stories of children actually saying they did a violent crime because of the video game.

	The third project was called the Formal Research paper and this was hands down my favorite project. It was awesome. Usually I hate writing papers, its not something I am good at and I don’t enjoy it, but this paper was different. I was actually very focused on research and learning more about the topic I chose, space sciences. The main idea of this project is to take an academic discipline, so really any field of study and research the topic.  It would probably be a good idea to use the major you declared just so you can learn more about what you’re getting yourself into. However, it is ok if you don’t pick your major, I did not do that either. I picked space sciences because I wanted to know everything I could about space, ever since junior year of high school when I took basic astronomy. It was amazing how much I learned from this project alone just from research. I found websites that were irelelvant to my paper but stayed on them because I was so interested. I now understand how astronomers lives are, and different types of research they use, as well as getting a good idea of an average day for them. Along with researching the topic, you also are supposed to find a piece of technology that helped you choose the academic discipline you chose. In space sciences, everything is technology so I based my whole paper off that. 

	The Multimedia Remix project was the fourth project, and this was probably my least favorite. The project was to make a documentary about one of the three projects before this one.  As a group you then discuss which topic would be best and make you decision. My group consisted of two other guys and a girl and we ended up picking poverty. We thought it would be pretty easy to make a documentary on poverty with all the information there is out there, we were wrong! Making a documentary was very difficult because so much work is put into it. You need people who know how to use certain apps on computers and I didn’t know how to do everything so I was kind of stressed. It was sort of a hassle relying on other people to do the work and trying to communicate and find a day when we could all work on it. I’m not a fan of group projects for those reasons alone. Our documentary actually ended up being pretty good, we put videos and pictures together and a kid in my group made a voice over for it. The only advice I have for this project is to start early, we didn’t do this and it was definitely a hassle getting it done on time. Manage your time wisely and just get it out of the way early and not have to worry about it.

	The fifth and final project is the one I’m writing right now. This project is where you look back at all the previous projects and analyze them. You also give advice for future students if you have any. This project is probably the easiest of all because you literally are just recapping the semester.  The second part of this project is putting it on the website. Personally I don’t like the fact that we have to do an online version as well as a written version, but its really not that difficult. The tip I am going to give for this one is too go to class and learn how to use GitHub, the online version of this project. If you don’t know how to use that then you are screwed. As you new students enroll in this class, just know the teacher is very nice but doesn’t always talk about what is due that week, it is very easy to fall behind in this class because stuff is due every week and I sometimes wouldn’t remember. I fell way behind on this a it was really hard to catch myself up from this and it took almost an entire day to catch up however if you do this according to the schedule it really won’t take a lot of time.  

	All in all, I learned a lot this semester in WRA: 110 and it has been an adventure for sure. My advice for this class is to stay on top of things, its very easy to fall behind and you need to stay on top of things. Do all the work and this class shouldn’t be a problem at all. Good Luck!
