			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In 1999, an article on PBS stated that law enforcement officers arrested an estimated 2.5 million juveniles. Approximately 104,000 of these arrests were for violent crimes.  This is a horrible statistic and is something we should not be proud of. Young children should not be involved in crime; they should be having fun with their friends and going to school. In my opinion, the video game Grand Theft Auto is playing a role in crimes committed by juveniles. Grand Theft Auto is a video game series that allows players to take on the role of a criminal or a wannabe in the big city, typically an individual who plans to rise through the ranks of organized crime through the course of the game. The player is given various missions by kingpins and major idols in the city, which must be completed to progress through the storyline. Assassinations and other violent crimes are featured regularly. This game is rated “M” for mature and you must be 17+ years of age to purchase it, which seems fair to me because of all the violent crimes that do go on. However, many parents don’t see exactly what their children are playing and just go ahead and purchase it anyways thinking they will be ok.  Children and adolescents can become overly involved and even obsessed with videogames. Spending large amounts of time playing these games can create problems and even lead to children trying to reenact what they see in the game. </p>
