			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>If parents or guardians did these things with the kids before allowing them to play the game, I don’t think we would have nearly as much youth crime. I believe that if kids learned it was just a game, they would understand not to do these horrible things in real life. Seeing kids commit such harsh crimes is such an awful thing. I also believe that if parents teach their children not to do these crimes when they are young, there will be a higher chance that they stay away from these crimes as an adult too. Another solution I came up with was maybe children are playing the video games for too long every day and it’s making them aggressive because they are being aggressive in the video game. Maybe if adults shortened the amount of time kids were allowed to play the video game, they wouldn’t be as aggressive when they weren’t playing it. Young children by becoming addicted or playing these games constantly withdraw from society, they become more shy and less aware of true reality, they live in a fantasy video game-like land, by not interacting with other kids they become less aware of what and who they are suppose to be like, and unconsciously perceive things differently and falsely. Parents need to limit the amount of time they allow their kids to play these games to keep their kid healthy and in the right state of mind.  </p>
