			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>All in all, video games like Grand Theft Auto are very violent and you can commit many crimes in the game. Many crimes that young children should not even know about, let alone be committing in a video game. Kids could see these crimes and try to commit them in real life. There are so many real crimes committed by young kids where when they are being questioned by the police, they say they were inspired to do the crime by the video game Grand Theft Auto. This is just unacceptable, parents need to do a better job a parenting and sitting their kids down and letting them know these crimes are illegal and you can seriously harm someone or something or even end up in jail. The way I think we can slow these crimes down is lessening the amount of time parents let their kids play these games, and making sure they are know it is just a game. Video games can cause kids to become addicted or obsessed with the game and can create major problems and even lead to the kid committing the crime, which is the worst possible scenario.</p>
