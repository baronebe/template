			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Space science is the study of all objects and phenomena beyond the atmospheric boundaries of the Earth. Another term for space sciences would be astronomy, although astronomy has become something more then just the study of the outer universe, it has combined with Earth science so now it also involves time travel and space exploration. Space sciences are one of the most interesting and amazing fields to study in my opinion. Space is a scary but beautiful place, and without technology we would know not nearly as much about our universe as we do now. Technology is everything in the study of space, and the better the technology gets, the more and more we will know. The goal of space sciences is to learn more about our universe and its composition, and to ultimately learn more about the origin of life. Astronomy is a social activity in which people discuss new ideas, interpret data, and argue with each other over what certain observations mean. In astronomy there are two types of astronomers, observational and theoretical. Astronomers use two methods to display their information: research papers, and visual displays.</p>
