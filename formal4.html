			<p>Astronomers have a number of different channels through which scientific results are made known. The first method they use is research papers. Research papers are formal documents that allow scientists to present their data. Some of the common reasons in using research papers are they are very formal. They have been around for a very long time and are one of the easiest methods to use, especially for scientists. Research papers are easy to comprehend and digest. Research papers are written mainly so that other scientists can reproduce the experiment in the paper, as experiments are not considered valid if they cannot be reproduced. The second method astronomers use is a visual presentation. Scientists like to go observe these because they love getting days off work. They will gladly go watch fellow scientists give a presentation and expand their knowledge, because at the end of the day the goal of science is expanding knowledge. It is also very important for scientists to present their experiments so others can learn. Many times in visual presentations, scientists create visuals within visuals to demonstrate what is going on. These presentations are commonly very formal and are directly related to the experiment the scientists are talking about. </p>
