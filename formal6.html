			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>Research papers are always very professional. They are very formal and the goal is for it to look as presentable as possible. Authors of these are all about recognition and taking pride in what they discovered or think they discovered. A formal research paper done by an astronomer would include an abstract. An abstract is a brief summary of the article. Most scientists are very busy people with a lot of things on their schedule for the day, so scientists use abstracts in their papers. A scientist will read the abstract to get a good idea if the paper is worthy of reading or not, and then will decide if they want to read more in-depth about the article. The next part of the paper would be the introduction, where the author will explain why they are writing the paper and give some background information on it.  The following section of the paper is the Materials/ Methods section. Here the author explains to the readers what they did, and how they did it. They must say this in their paper because it cannot be considered an experiment if it cannot be reproduced by another scientist. It is only considered a valid experiment once it has been duplicated. After this they will discuss the results they came up with. They will present the data in a professional way, using many different diagrams and pictures to explain everything about the experiment. After this, they will have a discussion in their article about all the data analyzed and the conclusion the scientists reached after conducting the experiment. This is a very important part of the paper because conclusions are what drive science. Without a conclusion, you have nothing except a bunch of useless data. To conclude the research paper, the scientists will have a list of references, in which he may have gathered information from, or studied to complete his/ her experiment. 
	Visual presentations are a bit different then a research paper in that they can be more of a group project rather then individual. Visual presentations begin with the head scientist lecturing the audience about his/ her experiment. They will talk about the data they received, how they analyzed the data, and the results they came up with. After the formal presentation, the audience is aloud to ask many questions if they have any and the scientists will gladly answer them to the best of the presenterâ€™s knowledge.
