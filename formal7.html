			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>All in all, astronomy is one of the most interesting things to study on this Earth, it is a crazy mysterious place, that astronomers are trying to figure out. So many factors contribute to discovering new theories and finding new things. It is one of the hardest jobs in the world. Astronomers must first form a hypothesis, then spend endless weeks researching and watching the object they are studying, then they analyze the information, and try to come up with a reasonable conclusion. Other astronomers then agree or disagree with the theory and can take years to prove one little thing. Research papers or visual presentations are how astronomers present their information, it must be very formal and they need to know everything about what they are studying in case someone has questions or questions them. After analyzing many articles online, I realized that it is not an easy job, and takes hours and hours of time, and in the end, your work could make history or mean absolutely nothing, thatâ€™s why I think it is such an interesting topic.</p>
