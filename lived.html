		<h1>Lived Experiences Project </h1>
		<p>As a child I had very messed up teeth, and was very embarrassed by it. I was scared to smile, talk to girls, even or some guys for that matter. My family was very supportive of it and always had my back telling me to not worry about it. That didn’t mean anything to me because I knew my teeth were very crooked. Eventually, as I lost all my baby teeth and was very fortunate to have the parents I have. My parents scheduled an appointment with an orthodontist and told me it was time to fix my problem. I am so blessed they did this for me, braces aren’t cheap and I thank my parents everyday for what they did for me. Braces are a dental appliance constructed of bands and wires that is fixed to the teeth to correct irregular alignment. The day of my appointment finally came and I couldn’t have been more excited. My orthodontist, Dr. Marx, called me back into his office and started to check out my teeth. He told me I definitely needed braces and I would have them on for about a year and a half. He told me to come back in a few weeks and we would get my braces on. The day finally came, and I was getting my braces on. I was the happiest kid alive. 
	After getting my braces on, I realized it wasn’t all that great. I couldn’t eat certain foods, and had to be careful of my mouth because it was very sensitive. My teeth were always really sore and I hated it. My parents were very positive and supportive because they knew how self-conscious I was. I gained a little bit of confidence as my braces started to straighten out my teeth.  It was a great feeling knowing one day my teeth would be perfect, and that’s what gave me my confidence. After about a year and half, my teeth were very straight and I was hoping to get my braces off in the middle of sophomore year. My appointment came when I was supposed to get my braces off, and I was so excited. As Dr. Marx was checking out my teeth, he told me he had some bad news, and my heart sunk. He told me I had at least another year with braces on because my back teeth were just starting to grow in and they were pushing all my teeth forward. I needed surgery to pull a few teeth and then move some around. It was honestly one of the worst days of my life. I had to go another year of watching what I eat and people making fun of me calling me “brace face” and things like that. 
	After a year of going through hell and misery, March 14th 2012 came along and it was one of the happiest days of my life, the day my braces came off. I walked into the orthodontist office with a huge smile on my face, knowing today was the day that would change the rest of my life. Dr. Marx proceeded to take off my braces, and it hurt really bad, but I didn’t care at all because I knew my teeth would be perfect. Sure enough after he had taken them off, I looked in the mirror and just smiled, I had more confidence in myself then ever before. I walked out of the orthodontist’s office with a bigger smile then I had when I walked in. Braces changed my life completely. Girls would actually come up and talk to me first telling me how good they looked, and actually seemed interested. For the first time in my life, I actually felt good about my teeth and more importantly, myself. Braces are hands down the one and only piece of technology that made me want to pursue the career I am now pursuing. 
	After seeing how happy Dr. Marx made me by fixing my teeth, I realized that I was very passionate about it. I wanted to help others just like the doctor helped me. I wanted to fix peoples teeth. Teeth are the first thing I notice about someone, it’s definitely my first impression. I try not to be judgmental because at one point in time, my teeth were disgusting but teeth can make or break a person for me, especially when I am interested in a girl. This is the main reason I want to continue down the Dental path. Fixing someone’s teeth is something I would really love doing. Just seeing someone smile after I worked on their teeth would honestly be one of the best feelings in the world. Especially someone who isn't confident in his or her smile. I would want to help as many people as I could, because when the doctor helped me out, it made me so happy to see that he actually cared. That’s what I want one day, to actually care about my patients and make sure I help them to the best of my ability.
	Dental school is going to be one of the hardest things that I will go through. I am going to have to work my ass off the rest of college to even get in. Once I get accepted into dental school is when everything will change. I wont have a social life any more; all I will do is study. But that’s ok with me, I will go to class everyday and learn everything I need to know to one day become a Dentist. This is one of my biggest goals in life and nothing will stop me from achieving it.
	One day down the road from now, I hope to have completed dental school at the top of my class and open my own practice with my best friend Tyler. Tyler and I had the same problem growing up, having messed up teeth and always getting made fun of for it. The kids that made fun of us gave us that drive to one day become professional dentists. We want to open a practice with me being a dentist and Tyler being an orthodontist, this would make it very easy to both get your teeth cleaned and have your teeth checked out for braces. We want to do this more then anything, nothing would be better then being able to boosts kids and evens adults confidence by fixing their smile. It’s amazing how much someone’s life can change by their teeth, and one day I hope to be the guy that changes peoples lives and makes them feel more confident in themselves. 
	All in all, if things would’ve happened differently, and I wouldn’t have gotten braces as a child I don’t think I would be the same person I am today. They have boosted my confidence and self esteem. They have changed my life completely, I went from being a very shy kid who was scared to talk to people because of the fact I’d get made fun of, to a very outgoing kid who loves to smile. In my opinion, braces are one of the best inventions anyone has ever made. They really can change a persons life.
