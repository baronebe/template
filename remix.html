		<h1>Course Retrospect Project</h1>
		<p>The topic we chose was poverty. Poverty affected the way we composed our documentary by us mainly having to research everything.  As I researched everything, I realized how many people were actually in poverty. It really opened my eyes to the topic and made me realize how terrible the topic was. We came across a few problems while trying to compose our documentary. One of the problems we had was struggling to find information on specific topics we needed information on, it was sort of a hassle, but as a whole we worked through it and found the information needed. The audience didnâ€™t really play a role in our project.
	We selected our topic because one of the people in my group did her lived experience project on it. We all agreed and decided poverty would be the best for this documentary. The most challenging part of our project was finding video clips to take up time while we used a voice over. It was the most difficult part because we had to find information that was relevant to what was being talked about. The approach we took was we assigned everyone a role to research a different topic and everyone found his or her stuff. The research resources that were most beneficial to us was definitely Google, everything we used was either from Google or YouTube. 
	I feel like our group worked very well together. Fred worked well with computers so he pretty much put the documentary together. Jamie, Stephen, and I all did the research and would post what we found on the D2L drop page. It was very convienient and I feel like we worked great as a team. I feel like working in groups was fruitful, it was much more efficient and we finished a lot faster then if we were working individually.  Our group planned our worked pretty well,  we set up different days to meet, and would text each other and figure stuff out through that as well. If we could do the project over again the only thing I would change is working on it more often. 
	The most effective aspect in our documentary would definitely be the voice over that Fred does. He really does a good job with presenting all the facts we found. Our group came together as a whole and pretty much decided on decisions as a whole, it was definitely a team effort.
